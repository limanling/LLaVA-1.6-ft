# Quality of Service (QOS); think of it as sending your job into a special queue; --qos=long for with a max job length of 7 days.
# uncomment ##SBATCH --qos=long if you want your job to run longer than 48 hours, which is the default for normal partition,
# NOTE- in the hns partition the default max run time is 7 days , so you wont need to include qos, also change to normal partition
# since dev max run time is 2 hours.

# We are submitting to the dev partition, there are several on sherlock: normal, gpu, bigmem (jobs requiring >64Gigs RAM)
##SBATCH -p dev
#################
# --mem is memory per node; default is 4000 MB per CPU, remember to ask for enough mem to match your CPU request, since
# sherlock automatically allocates 4 Gigs of RAM/CPU, if you ask for 8 CPUs you will get 32 Gigs of RAM, so either
# leave --mem commented out or request >= to the RAM needed for your CPU request.  It will also accept mem. in units, ie "--mem=4G"
